Discussion summary: We discussed the grade and comments that we received from the instructor on the Requirements deliverable. 
Veronica agreed to meet with the instructor on Monday during his office hours to discuss some of his comment. 
Rob will try and come too, if traffic allows. In terms of the Design deliverable, Rob explained the research he had done on the 
API for Java classes to help in reading and parsing web pages, etc. This changed the UML class diagram a bit and he passed out 
copies of the changes he saw needed to be made due to his research. Rob suggested we take the diagram and individually continue 
working on it and complete the sequence diagrams over the weekend as best we can. Veronica brought up that we are all a little 
vague on the graph still, so we should all research graphs and we can discuss again on Monday when we make a final draft of class 
diagram. Celia, Rob, Veronica and Ikuro are to individually finish the UML class diagram and to complete the sequence diagrams 
for our 2 user-goal level use cases and have done by Monday. Ikuro will post the revised SRS to the document repository so we can 
all access it for our sequence diagrams.
